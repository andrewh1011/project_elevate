Idea for dynamic pdf loading:

1) Have user choose pdf file that they want to import, give the datasource a name(ie workday).

2) Load this pdf file in an interactive viewer ui.

3) Have user click on row element of report data.

4) extract all elements that share this metadata.

This would allow use to avoid hardcoding 9 or so(one for each input platform) 
routines for pdf parsing and instead have one way. 

This assumes the pdf files have a defined structure, and it isnt just a block of text.
