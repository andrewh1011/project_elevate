# Semester Plan

## *Project Elevate*

## *Andrew Hartmann & Nicholas Fletcher*

# **Code maintenance and storage**

- All of our code will be stored in a github repository.  
  - [https://github.com/andrewh1011/project\_elevate](https://github.com/andrewh1011/project_elevate)

# **Tracking development & progress**

- For tracking our development, we will be using the github project feature. This will allow all of our content to be located in one place.

# **Programming languages & frameworks**

- *Main application* \- Python 3  
  - Pandas library for data processing  
  - PyQT5 library for user interface  
- *Displaying final report*  \- Excel

# **Deployment**

- Our app will be used locally by the clients, so there will be no deployment needed besides sending the executable and source code to them.

# **Testing**

- Will feed our program the provided input sample data and compare the result of our program with the behavior of Technical Sergeant Westâ€™s existing program.  
- We can potentially coordinate with Technical Sergeant West or someone else from the medical team and have them use our program to test.
