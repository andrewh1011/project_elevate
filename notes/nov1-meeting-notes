November 1st Meeting:

Before meeting:

Plan for meeting:
- Progress update - our application now can generate an output from multiple files, UI updates
- Demo - show them updated UI and output generation
- Take questions

Questions we have:

- Are the required columns we currently have enough?
- Would it be possible to send the application to Technical Sergeant West for testing?
- Sample data?

During meeting:

- 210-683-4221 Captain Larson #, text her if no sample data by Monday
- We can have a meeting with Technical Sergeant West for testing!
- Application delivery still in air 
  • Executable file would be easier to run than Python script, but permissions for executable may be challenging 
  • Running a python script would be hard for the non technical folks
  • Talk with Technical Sergeant West about permissions
- Demo went well!
