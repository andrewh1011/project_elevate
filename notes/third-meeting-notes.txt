September 27th Meeting

Questions:

- Could you walk us through all the pictures?
- What do the final reports look like?
- What are the important data points that we need to keep track of?
- Any updates on Python?
- How would the maintenance work?

Notes:
Edipi: unique identifier for each person
Tsgt west already has proof of concept for this app
Look up id number, grab name

Output looks like -> ID, Last Name, First Name, and a compilation of trainings from multiple sources and whether or not they have been completed

Idea: take first last name trim whitespace combine into one string and map to unique dodid/edipi number for lookup


Donâ€™t care about level of completion, just whether they are done or not 

Tsgt west recommends moving away from excel, making standalone app. Team isnt very proficient with excel and will not use the excel report once he leaves

Upload everything to folder, run python script, output report card

Status: AD (active duty) or CIV (civilian), some trainings are only active duty

Python and executable may be blocked 

Probably stay away from executable

Python more likely, can move ahead 

tyler.m.west2.mil@health.mil - forwarded him the email chain

Monthly plans - specific goals
Semester plan - high level
