Before meeting notes:

Our Medical Group needs a system/database that can sort and report names and due dates for electronic training. Currently, they have to pull training completion reports from roughly 9 different platforms and manually insert names and completion dates into an excel. If there is a bot that could do that, or a system that you can insert the reports into in order to auto sort this data, that is what they are looking for. If it could auto-populate into some sort of spreadsheet, that would also be ideal.

• What are the names of the ~9 platforms?
• Can we get sample data from each of the platforms’ reports?
• How will we get access to the data?
• Does the data consist of just names and dates?
• Preferred language/framework?
• Will this be a standalone application or some sort of webapp/api?
• Is excel the preferred output, any other formats needed?

Meeting summary:

• Elevate has a list of people to get trained
 - Need to report who has completed training from all the systems (there are different levels of completion)
 - Multiple training systems
 - They combine all systems to one database (currently an Excel sheets) manually, which can take up to a day

• Want a system to combine all systems to one database (ie Excel sheets)
 - Data is currently only names and dates of completion
 - Dates needs to be sorted
 - The data is stored in files (pdf?)
 - Suggested we use Python
 - They use MS office 365, windows, excel
