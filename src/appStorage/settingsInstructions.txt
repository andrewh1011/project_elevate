When working with files without an email or ID (our preferred identifiers), we identify people based on their names. Sometimes, across files, these names do not match up one-to-one. For instance, John Doe in one file may be John F. Doe in another. 

To combine records by name, we employ a name scoring system.
This system takes two names and scores the similarity of them from 0 to 100, where 0 means they have nothing in common and 100 means they are exactly the same.

The "name match threshold" is an exclusive lower bound on the scores that will cause a match based on names to be considered in the first place. If you are finding that the app is either asking you to manually confirm or is automatically confirming names that are not similar enough, you should raise this value. Putting this value to 100 effectively turns the name matching system off.

The "auto match threshold" is an exclusive lower bound on the scores that will cause an automatic match without the user's permission. If you are finding that the app is asking you to often manually confirm two names which are extremely similar(or the same) you should raise this number. If you observe, via the logs, that the app is making automatic name matches that you dont agree with, you should lower this number. Putting this value to 100 effectively turns off the automatic matching.
