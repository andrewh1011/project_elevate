This application is designed to automate the process of outputing a report card of training data across multiple sources.

The application requires Excel (.xlsx) files from the training sources. You can import these files by clicking the "Import" button. 

Once imported, the application will ask you which source they came from (ie JKO, myLearning, ect.). Please choose the correct source from the dropdown menu. 

If the source is not in the dropdown menu or a source changes format, you can manually add a new data souce with the "Add Source" button.

Import as many files as necessary. Once all files have been added, click the "Create Output" button. This will generate an output in an Excel file (output.xlsx) in the same directory as the application.
